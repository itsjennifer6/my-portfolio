		<p id="overview"> This web portfolio includes of my work in Mr. Figuroa's Communication Design Class. It also includes my reflections (below)
			on what I learned in each unit of the course. 
		</p>
	</main>
	
	<h2> Unit 2 </h2>
		<p> In Unit Two, I learned how to I learned how to do basic HTML mark-up, how to create lists, how to create a table and how to create links. </p>
		<p>I think the most important thing I learned was how to do the basic HTML mark-up and how to create lists. The basic stuff is important because,</p>
		<p>without it, the code would not make any sense or wouldn;t be complete. Creating lists was also important because they allow you to look at information </p>
		<p>quickly.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the HTML videos</li>
			<li>the text detailaing what everything was</li>
			<li>the activties</li>
			<li>the outside information</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2> Unit 3 </h2>
		<p> In Unit 3, I learned how to set up and make my own website using both HTML and CSS. First, I was introduced to CSS, how it worked, and how it
			should be formatted. I learned how to start a code in CSS and some specific vocabulary such as selector and property value. I got use this 
			information to build the basics of my website. I also learned how to add deatil to a website using CSS. I learned about how to arrange color 
			typography of a website so that not only can a website be readable but it can also look appealing. I learned about the box model and how margins, 
			borders, and padding worked together to create the "space" of a website. Finally, I learned about how to create the layout of the website, which 
			was the most frustrating part of the assignment. 
		</p>
		<p> Some things I found important were: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> How to format a website through coding</li>
			<li> The different types of typography that are the most useful</li>
			<li> How to add small details to a website</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2> Unit 4 </h2>
		<p>
			In Unit 4, I was introduced into the use of web graphics. I learned how to use them correctly and 
			where to search for them so that I didn't violate any copyright laws. I also learned how to edit 
			web graphics, like cropping and resizing images, to make it look the best that it could possibly 
			look on my website. 
			In addition, I learned how to create both a button and a banner with the help of Photoshop. I learned
			how to physically edit images in photoshop to match my website and how to put those buttons and banners
			onto my website. 
		</p>
		
		<p> Some things I found important were: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Finding the rigth web graphics from the right websites</li>
			<li> How to create a banner</li>
			<li> The different types of back grounds there are</li>
		</ul>

	<h2> Unit 5 </h2>
		<p> 
			In Unit 5, I learned more about how to code in Javascript. At the beginning of the lesson, I learned 
			some concepts of Javascript like what client-side scripting was versus what server-side scripting was. 
			After the basics, I learned how to code a multitude of things in Javascript such as how to show an alert, 
			how to debug my page, how to build a Javascript clock, and how to add my own video buttons.
			In addition, I was able to practice my coding skills by adding my own styles, function, and css code. 
		</p>
